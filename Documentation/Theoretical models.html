<h1>Theoretical models</h1>
    <p>Each group of datapoints can be refined with its own combination of theoretical models. For detailed description of the models see the <a href="Theoretical models.html">Theoretical models</a> section. If you want to fit the datapoints corresponding to the individual groups, the <i>Fit groups</i> tickbox has to be ticked. Check, if you have all mandatory information for the refinement according to the model (e.g. material constants, or azimuthal &#966 angles). If a problem would arise during the refinement, the program will produce warning or error dialogs to suggest what is probably wrong.</p>
    
    <p>If the refinement is successfuly finished, the results are plotted in the graphs on the left side of the main window and printed as a text and numbers inside the <i>Result section</i> (also printed in the Matlab console). The figures and results can be then saved by the <i>Save figures</i> and <i>Save results</i> buttons respectively.</p>
